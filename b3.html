                <p>The International Bestseller: DO IT TODAY Are you also tired of putting off your dreams until "tomorrow?" Guess what! Tomorrow never comes. Am I right? I've procrastinated and putt off my desire to write a book for a decade. I always came up with excuses like, "it's not the right time." Or, "I need to do more research." But in 2015 I got tired of this endless procrastination, and finally took action. Six months later, my first book was published. Look, we all have limited time on our hands. And we're getting closer to death every single minute. That shouldn't scare. That should motivate you! Time is limited, that's why we must do the things we want: Today. In this "best of" collection, I've handpicked 30 of my best articles that help you to overcome procrastination, improve your productivity, and achieve all the things you always wanted. Plus, I've written an extensive introduction about my life and work philosophy. And I've made many improvements and edits to the articles. So the content of this book is different from the articles on my site. In Do It Today, you'll learn: 1.Why we procrastinate and how we can overcome it 2.How to increase your productivity without being stressful 3.How to achieve more meaningful things in your life so you can enjoy it more Are you ready to start reading this book? If so: Do it today-not tomorrow.</p>
